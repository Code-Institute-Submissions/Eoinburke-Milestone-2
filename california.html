            <h1>California</h1>

            <p>
                There is a reason why California is often romanticized in movies and popular culture – this place is
                bursting with sunshine and a sense of adventure! From great weather, fantastic theme parks, fascinating
                history, stunning National Parks and adventurous hiking spots – there is so much that this spectacular
                place has to offer!

                You’ll be amazed by the natural beauty of the Redwood forest, Joshua Tree, and Big Sur. And you’ll love
                exploring major cities like San Diego, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Add to that great food, amazing
                road trips, cool camping spots, and incredible sightseeing opportunities – California is one of my
                favorite places in the world. California actually has a late summer, so you’ll be surprised with some
                colder weather in May and June. July to September is when things start to heat up. October is my
                all-time favorite month in Southern California. You get the BEST sunsets and have a nice balance of warm
                and cool weather.

                    <p>
                        Home of the famous Irish “Black Gold”, learn about Guinness’s history, see
                        how it’s made, and enjoy a pint from the panoramic bar. This is a massive tourist trap of
                        course, so be prepared for crowds. However, it’s worth it for all the old Guinness ads and the
                        view from the Gravity Bar at the top of the Storehouse. Despite the crowds, it is something you
                        need to tick off the bucketlist of things to see in Dublin.

                    <p>
                        Death Valley is one of the most underrated national parks in my opinion! There park is so
                        diverse that even on your second or third visit you will easily find new things to do. Located
                        in the Mojave Desert of California, Death Valley is famous for its rugged landscapes, extreme
                        temperatures, and unique natural sights. It’s known to be one of the hottest and driest places
                        on earth and for many Death Valley has truly lived up to its name… but don’t let that fool you!
                        There is so much beauty within the park and it truly is a bucket list destination. In this blog
                        post, I am going to share everything you need to know to plan your own visit!

                    <h3>Alcatraz Island</h3>
                    <p>
                        From the shore, Alcatraz Island doesn’t look too far away.

                        I squinted into the distance and could just about see the tiny island 1.5 miles from mainland
                        San Francisco. A low cloud hung over ‘The Rock’ giving it an eerily ominous appearance.

                        Despite the creepy air of mystery surrounding Alcatraz, I still thought I could swim the
                        distance.

                        “Yea, I could swim it,’ I said cockily, making one of those brave statements I know I’d never
                        have to prove, therefore making me say it with even more self assurance.

                        I wasn’t the only one with this self-belief in my non-existent swimming ability. Reportedly, 36
                        men attempted to escape from Alcatraz and “officially’ not one man made it.
                        Alcaztra was a military prison in 1868 and a federal prison from 1933 until 1963. It is situated
                        on a rocky outcrop within San Francisco Bay. It may only be 1.5 miles to the mainland but due to
                        the strong currents and cold water temperatures, it’s almost impossible for prisoners to escape.
