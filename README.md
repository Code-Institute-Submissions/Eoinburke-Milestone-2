# Travel
This is my interactive Travel website. Utilizing [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps), [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/marketplace), JavaScript, Jquery. The website helps the user by giving reviews and expierences in diffrent countries.

## Project Goals
My aim for the project is to incorpirate various API's so the user can access multiple information at once ranging from flights, accomadation and maps.

## External User Goals
