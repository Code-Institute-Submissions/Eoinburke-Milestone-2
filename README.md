This is my interactive Travel website. Utilizing [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps), [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/marketplace), JavaScript, Jquery. The website helps the user by giving reviews and expierences in diffrent countries.

## Project Goals
My aim for the project is to incorpirate various API"s so the user can access multiple information at once ranging from accomadation and maps. The main idead of the website is more so a blog of places ive been to in the past. Users can read information on each place see where it is located on the map, and they are able to view and book accomadation as well.

## External User Goals
* To find new holiday destinations, find accomadation and tourist destinations.

* Be able to plan ahead and plan travel routes.

* This website is my own personal blog of places I have travelled to. I wanted to to add destination for each place I thought were woth while seeing.


### Site owner's goal
To help usesrs choose their next holiday destination.

Make navigating through the website easy and understandable.

## UX
### Strategy
Display data from [Rapid-API](https://rapidapi.com/) displaying local hotels in the searched location.

### Scope
Within the scope of the project I have an interactive map that displays markers based on latitude and longitude data from the database.

I have also added an API for when a user searches a location in the world hotels in the surrounding area will show.

# Wireframe Mockups
# Structure
The website has multiple pages the user can navigate through.
## Home
 Gives a brief insite into each location. A short clip plays on loop in the background that will be related to each location.

 ## Destination Page
 When the user is in the home menu they will notice two arrows on the bottom right of the page. When they scroll throught the slides they will be met with a new destination, they will also notice a button at the end of the paragraph that is interactive that will bring them to a new page that will have a discription about the place and notable places that I feel are worth visiting.

# Skeleton
# Features 
 When the user loads the web page they are met with a location title and a brief discription about that place. They will be able to navigate through the diffrent areas by clicking the arrows on the bottom left of the page.
# Home Page
 * On the bottom left hand side of the web page there are some clickable icons that will bring the user to my Facebook, Instagram and my first Milestone project.
 * On the bottom right hand side of the bage there are two directional arrows each button will bring you to the next slide which will reveal a diffrent location, discription and a short video playing on loop.

 ## Nav-bar
 * The nav-bar has clickable link that will bring the user to a new page.
 * When hovering over a nav-bar link the background color changes to a solid white and the cursor changes to a pointer.
 
 ## Home page interactive buttons
 * On the bottom right hand of the screen there is a white bar going up the page. I have added my interactive social media links so when a user clicks on them it will bring them to my social media pages.
 * On the opposite side of the page there are two interactive arrow keys that allow the user scroll through the content.

 # Travel page
 When the user navigates through the nav-bar to the travel page they will be met by my [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps). There will be drop points placed on the map indicating where the countries listed on the home page are located. These are just some of the countries I have visited in the past. The map is interactive, the user can zoom in and out of the map and they can also choose to view it in map form terrain and satellite and this can be done on the top left corner of the page.

# Book 
When the user gets to this section they will be met by a search bar and when they search a location a list of hotels in that area will appear on screen.

# Contact 
This section is for users if they have any more questions they can leave their phone number and email and someone can get in contact with them regarding their question.

# Features left to implant
Towards the end I had problems inserting marker labels on my Google Maps API I would have like to have added labels.

# Testing errors
## Responsiveness
The website works as intended in Chrome, Mozilla and Microsoft Edge, on mobile it is not very responsive at all. I found it very difficult to get the hamburger menu working. I was able to get the header and paragraph on the home page responsive to screen size.

# Problems encounterd 
* I had difficulty displaying my google maps API at the beginning, I had to put all my JavaScript code on my travel.html for it to work correctly.
* My Rapid API's I found extremely difficult to work correctly. It will not load at the moment as I am getting '429' errors. I have attached a link to a [screenshot](milestone/assets/images/API(1).jpg) when I had it working correctly
