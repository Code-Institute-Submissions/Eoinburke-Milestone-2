# Travel

## Project Goals
My aim for the project is to incorpirate various API's so the user can access multiple information at once ranging from flights, accomadation and maps.

# Features 
 When the user loads the web page they are met with a location title and a brief discription about that place.
## Home Page
 * On the bottom left hand side of the web page there are some clickable icons that will bring the user to my Facebook, Instagram and my first Milestone project.
 * On the bottom right hand side of the bage there are two directional arrows each button will bring you to the next slide which will reveal a diffrent location, discription and a short video playing on loop.
 ## Nav-bar
 * The nav-bar has clickable link that will bring the user to a new page.
 * When hovering over a nav-bar link the background color changes to a solid white and the cursor changes to a pointer.
