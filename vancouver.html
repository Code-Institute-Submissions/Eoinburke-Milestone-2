            <h2>Vancouver</h2>
            <p>
                Vancouver is perfectly positioned between the ocean and the mountains. With that being said, this lends
                itself to many wonderful outdoor things to do in Vancouver – any nature lovers delight! If you’re skiing
                head to Vancouver before Christmas to enjoy ice skating, festive light displays and Christmas tree
                competitions. Otherwise, the best time to visit is between May-September for the long, sunny summers.
                There is plenty to do within the city, but actually, some of the best things to do in Vancouver actually
                require getting a little out of town!
                Luckily, everything is either a short bus, train or boat ride away. All of the suggestions outlined
                below are within 1-1.5 hours from downtown Vancouver and are perfect as half-day to day trips.

                    <h3>Stanley Park</h3>
                    <p>
                        Stanley Park in Vancouver, British Columbia is a massive park almost entirely framed by the
                        Pacific Ocean. It is 400 hectares in size (just under a 1000 acres) and sits right in downtown
                        Vancouver. It is packed with things to do, like walking and bike trails, playgrounds, water
                        activities, restaurants, and recreational sports’ attractions. It’s a local’s and tourist’s
                        mecca that is waiting for you to discover whether you have a few hours, or a couple days to
                        spare. The Stanley Park seawall is a 5.5mi or 9km uninterrupted paved path around Stanley Park.
                        It has stunning views of the park, the ocean, downtown Vancouver and the North Shore Mountains.
                        I have been to over 65 countries and I have rarely seen another city with more beautiful views
                        than from this path.

                    <h3>Joffre Lakes</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Joffre Lakes trail is without a doubt one of the most spectacular hikes in British Columbia,
                        Canada. Located just about 2.5 hours drive from Vancouver Airport, Joffre Lakes Provincial Park
                        has become a bucket-list adventure for almost everyone who visits British Columbia for its
                        stunning wilderness scenery. The Joffre Lakes trail, with its three stunning turquoise water
                        lakes and breathtaking views of the glaciers, gives hikers an easily accessible opportunity to
                        experience some amazing alpine scenery, without having to trek into the British Columbia
                        backcountry for days. It can be easily completed as a day hike, or an overnighter with camping
                        sites available at the far end of the trail – right at the Joffre Lakes Glacier footsteps.

                    <h3>Deep Cove </h3>
                    <p>
                        Deep Cove is a small neighborhood with an even smaller “village” on Gallant Street. It was a
                        traditional fishing and clamming village back in the day; now it’s only us locals in the winter
                        and early spring. Summer and fall, it’s open season – tourists from all over the world are
                        welcome! I love walking through Panorama Park, listening to all the different languages and
                        accents. Tourists from all over the world visit Deep Cove, and I hope to see you here one day
                        :-)
                        This isn’t your typical list of sights and activities on the North Shore. If you search for
                        things to do in Deep Cove, you’ll easily find a list of world-famous tourist sights and popular
                        activities:
                        <ul>
                   <li> Honey Doughnuts and Goodies for world-famous honey-soaked donuts</li>
                    <li>The Deep Cove Kayak Center for kayaking and stand up paddle boarding</li>
                    <li>The grassy parts and picnic areas of Panorama Park for summer concerts, picnics, and year-round
                        BBQs</li>
                    <li>The beach at Panorama Park for swimming, sun bathing, people watching, crab petting</li>
                    <li>Quarry Rock for a short, mildly challenging hour-long hike with a breathtaking view of Deep Cove
                        and Panorama Park</li>
                    <li>Wickenden Park (my favorite place as a Deep Cove local)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Grouse Mountain</h3>
                    <p>
                        Grouse Mountain is over 1,200 metres / 2,000 feet high and is as impressive at it’s base as it
                        is at it’s summit based on sheer size alone! Grouse Mountain is a ski-resort, bear spotting
                        location, theatre, zip-lining destination and so much more! It’s a multi-purpose destination but
                        there’s definitely something for everyone up on there. Random Fact: Grouse Mountain’s first
                        lodge was hand-built by Scandinavians in the 1920s! Whatever time of year you go, Grouse
                        Mountain is so packed with activities that you can easily spend the entire day there. If you
                        love fine dining, you won't want to miss a chance to have dinner or dessert at The Observatory,
                        which boasts some of the most breathtaking views of any restaurant in Metro Vancouver.

                        From wildlife watching to mountain movies and epic views, there's fun for all the family at
                        Grouse Mountain. Here are some of the major attractions that you'll find there:
