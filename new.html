            <h2>New York</h2>
            <p>
                There is so much to see in New York City! Its bustling streets are a whirlwind of activity, and there
                are world-famous sites around every corner. From the iconic landmarks like the Brooklyn Bridge to the
                city’s incredible food scene and the fascinating museums, you could spend months exploring NYC. Here’s
                my ultimate New York travel guide to help you plan an unforgettable trip!
                Home to around 10 million people, NYC has tons of things to see and do. You can barely scratch the
                surface on a typical four- or five-day visit. (But, then again, I don’t think even a four-month trip
                would be enough to see NYC! The city is constantly changing too much.)

                New York is impossible to “see” in one visit. This city is home to thousands of restaurants, hundreds of
                museums, attractions, plays, and quirky things to do. You just have to resign yourself to that fact,
                unless you move here (and maybe not even then), you’re only going to see a fraction of what you hope to
                see. It takes a while to get around town.

                    <h3>Grand centeral park</h3>
                        <p>
                            Without a plan or internal gps system, you can run around New York City’s Central Park all
                            day long – like I did. Literally. I ran. Well, not the entire day, but definitely a huge
                            portion of my morning.

                            Our hotel was within walking distance of Central Park so I went for a jog and came back
                            several hours later because I kept telling myself I knew where I was going. And this was
                            certainly a shortcut.

                            Nope. Just kept running in circles – and sometimes things that were on my left 15 minutes
                            earlier somehow ended up on my right. Yep. I was lost.

                    <h3>Brooklyn Bridge</h3>
                    <p>
                        Built from 1869 to 1883 by 600 workers, the Brooklyn Bridge has influenced the hearts and minds
                        of New Yorkers for decades.

                        You can join a guided walking tour or do your own jaunt across the suspension. The entrance
                        begins at the intersection of Tillary Street and Adams Street. Look for the collection of love
                        locks near the Manhattan Tower—the padlocks there are a tribute to everlasting love.

                    <h3>Times square</h3>
                    <p>
                        Times Square is often called the “crossroads of the world,” and with good reason. At 300,000
                        visitors every day (and around a million on New Year’s Eve), it’s one of the most popular
                        tourist destinations in the world. Located in Midtown — the geographical heart of Manhattan —
                        the lights of Times Square are so bright they can be seen from space.

                        All of that energy is palpable, and it sometimes feels like New York City gets its mojo from all
                        the action in Times Square. The lights, the shopping, the characters, and the marquees of
                        Broadway all come to a head in the five blocks that stretch from 42nd Street to 47th Street.
