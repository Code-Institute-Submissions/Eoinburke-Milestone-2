            <h2>Amsterdam</h2>
            <p>
                Amsterdam has a fascinating history and is part of the reason this city is on so many travelers’ bucket lists. It’s truly one-of-a-kind, and offers so many different kinds of experiences. Amsterdam has impressive public transportation and offers travelers bicycles, metros, buses, ferries and trains to help you get around the city and beyond. Getting around Amsterdam is also very cheap, just a Euro or two per ride, so you have lots of options!

                    <h3>Vondel Park</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you didn’t go away to spend the afternoon dozing (fair enough!) you can join in with any number of activities around Vondelpark.

Hire bicycles here for the classic Dutch bike ride, going around the park and heading out along the streets and canals of Amsterdam. Or how about renting inline skates from Vondeltuin for you to zoom around the park on.

There’s even a  Friday Night Skate that leaves outside the old Film Museum pavilion in Vondelpark, which takes you on 20km tours of the area – free of charge.

If all that sounds a little too energetic you can always settle back on the grass to enjoy an outdoor concert or play at Openluchttheater (open air theatre) – free of charge once again.

Or if your visit to the Van Gogh museum has inspired you to try your hand at a little painting you’ll find outdoor art classes in Vondelpark too, with groups setting up their easels to paint the lovely scenery.

                    <h3>Anne Frank House</h3>
                    <p>
                        In all honesty, I don’t like this place. I found it to be anticlimactic. You basically do a slow walk through the house as the crowds pack the place. You don’t get to let everything soak in as you’re being pushed from behind by the endless crowds. It’s maddening! But, if you don’t mind waiting in line and you’re curious about Anne (I think the Jewish History Museum does a more thorough job of relating the events in Anne Frank’s life to the Holocaust), it might be worth the visit for you. You can book tickets online up to two months in advance, which lets you skip the line. If you don’t do this, get there very early in the morning to avoid the long queue that develops over the course of the day!

                    <h3>Canal Tour</h3>
                    <p>
                       Amsterdam is a city tied to the water – it grew around its canals and the taming of the Amstel River. The canals of Amsterdam are incredibly beautiful, and there’s nothing like seeing the city from a boat. Skip the big canal boat tours you see around the city — they’re overpriced. You can often hire a private boat tour for about 20 Euros an hour (look for guides around the Red Light District). Moreover, you can also take the open-air open boat tour. The boats are small, the tours more intimate, and your captain will give you a good personalized tour. The tours last about an hour and it leaves from Damrak Pier 6, Central Station East, Leidseplein, and Rijksmuseum. Prices start from 19.50 euros.
