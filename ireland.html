            <h1>Ireland</h1>

            <p>
                The Isle of Ireland, made up of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, is a popular destination
                with travellers. Full of iconic sights, such as the Cliffs of Moher, there are many reasons why it is an
                ideal holiday destination.
                <br>
                The Emerald Isle is fantastic for road trips, for hiking, discovering castles, eating seafood and
                sipping on whiskey. On top of the many buzzing cities, you could also explore the natural wonders and
                quaint villages that make up the countryside.
                <br>
                The 22-acre park is a Dublin treasure and an oasis of calm away from the hustle and bustle of downtown
                city life. When weather permits, you should do as the locals do and stretch out on the grass for some
                rest and relaxation, or grab a picnic lunch. Immaculate flowerbeds fringe the lawns. Also in the park is
                an ornate fountain at its center, a bridge over a duck pond, and a children's playground.
                <br>
                Incidentally, the park was the scene of bitter combat during the 1916 Uprising, however it was agreed by
                both sides that hostilities should cease while the park-keeper fed the ducks.

                    <h3>Guinness Storehouse</h3>
                    <p>
                        Home of the famous Irish “Black Gold”, learn about Guinness’s history, see
                        how it’s made, and enjoy a pint from the panoramic bar. This is a massive tourist trap of
                        course, so be prepared for crowds. However, it’s worth it for all the old Guinness ads and the
                        view from the Gravity Bar at the top of the Storehouse. Despite the crowds, it is something you
                        need to tick off the bucketlist of things to see in Dublin.

                    <h3>The Old Jameson Distillery</h3>
                    <p>
                        See where Jameson Whiskey was made until the 1970s and sip on some
                        of the legendary fire water. It’ll put hairs on your chest! This is one of my favourite tourist
                        attractions in Dublin. The staff are incredibly knowledgeable and it’s great value for money.
                        Try the Jameson and ginger complimentary cocktail at the end of the tour, it’s delicious.

                    <p>
                        Trinity College Dublin is Ireland's most prestigious university, a collection of elegant
                        Georgian and Victorian buildings, cobbled squares and nature-friendly wildflower meadows that
                        make for a delightful place to wander. Located next to Grafton Street in the heart of the city,
                        Trinity College is one of Ireland’s most visited sites, attracting more than two million
                        visitors per year. Its biggest draws are the barrel-vaulted Long Room in Old Library, one of the
                        most photographed rooms in Dublin, and the Book of Kells, the beautifully illuminated Gospel
                        manuscript that dates back to the 9th-century and is one of Ireland's greatest cultural
                        treasures.

                    <p>
                        Welcome to Connemara, a place of contrasts, colours, wilderness and warm welcomes on the west
                        coast of Ireland. From the bogs and lakes of the Gaelic speaking South Connemara, to the
                        mountain vistas of North and West Connemara, the diversity of the landscape and the people who
                        populate it offers much to the visitor.
                        Heading west from Galway city, the villages of Connemara will stretch out before you like a
                        colourful road map of communities and hidden gems just waiting to be explored. Each town or
                        village has its own distinct character and local culture, including Oughterard, Maam, Recess,
                        Roundstone, Cashel, Carna, Ballyconneely, Clifden, Cleggan, Claddaghduff, Letterfrack, the
                        Renvyle peninsula and Leenane. Don’t limit yourself though—some of the most beautiful places you
                        will see or enjoy may be off the beaten track and should be explored on foot, by bicycle or on a
                        boat!

                        Some of Ireland’s most beautiful beaches are located around the rugged coastline of
                        Connemara, with many and varied options for exploring, beachcombing, swimming, walking and more.
                        In this part of the world, you will never find yourself too far away from the great Atlantic
                        Ocean and a beach visit should certainly be a part of your Connemara experience. The beaches
                        detailed here are just some of the wonderful wet and sandy stretches that await the Connemara
                        visitor. Many more secluded and breathtakingly scenic spots are around every corner and at the
                        end of many roads, just waiting to be discovered. And don’t despair if the temperatures aren’t
                        too high – a good dose of Connemara sea air at any time of year will replenish the body and
                        soothe the soul in typical Connemara fashion.

                    <p>
                        Maybe it’s the gorgeous coastline, picturesque scenery or wealth of heritage sites but Kerry has
                        never been more popular. Further proof of that comes courtesy of global travel website Big 7
                        Travel’s countdown of the Top 50 Bucket List Destinations
                        With a rich history, delicious food, and unique wildlife, Kerry offers experiences for any
                        traveller. Learn what makes Kerry the best, and start planning your next trip.
                        Kerry faces the Atlantic Ocean and, typically for an Atlantic coastal region, features many
                        peninsulas and inlets. The county is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean and on the north
                        by the River Shannon. The Ring of Kerry on the Iveragh Peninsula is a popular route for tourists
                        and cyclists. The pedestrian version is the scenic Kerry Way which follows ancient paths
                        generally higher than that adopted by the Ring of Kerry.

                        Discover Kerry's DARK side at Kerry International Dark-Sky Reserve recently designated as
                        Ireland’s FIRST Dark-Sky region (Gold Tier).
                        The award of International Dark-Sky Reserve came from the International Dark-Sky Association
                        (www.darksky.org). This means that on clear moonless nights the sky in this South West region of
                        Ireland is simply stunning; with many more astronomical sights to be seen with the naked eye as
                        can be seen say in the Grand Canyon or the Desert Plains of Africa.
